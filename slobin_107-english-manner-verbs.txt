THE FULL LIST OF 107 VERBS OF MANNER-OF-MOVEMENT (INDIVIDUAL HUMAN, UNAIDED, DIRECTIONAL SELF-MOVEMENT)

From Slobin's email:
"[the list includes] intransitive verbs of human motion that move
the figure on a path from one location to another. (For example,
'writhe' doesn't appear on the first list because it doesn't typically
occur in path expressions.) [...]
[D]escriptions of an individual human being, moving under
their own motor action (thus excluding verbs like 'slip' and
'fall'), on a translational path (thus excluding verbs like
'spin' and 'whirl')"
