Nice to hear from you, Barbara!

Both lists were obtained the same way; the first list is a pared-down 
version, restricted to intransitive verbs of human motion that move 
the figure on a path from one location to another. (For example, 
writhe doesn't appear on the first list because it doesn't typically 
occur in path expressions.) The lists were generated by several 
semesters of undergrad research labs in a haphazard manner. First, 
each student was asked to write a list of all the motion verbs they 
could think of. From these, I made a composite list and we 
brainstormed for further examples. At the same time, we were all 
reading newspapers and novels, along with several grad research 
seminars, looking for contexts of use of manner of motion verbs. So 
additional verbs arose that way. And we did exhaustive OED searches, 
pulling out all the verbs cross-referenced and used in examples. So 
the collection arose in several ways, posing yet unsolved problems of 
doing the same for other languages.

A further problem, when it comes to psycholinguistic research, is to 
look at frequency of use in corpora of various types, and test 
people's understanding of the verbs. For example, I translated the 
shorter list into French, with the help of bilingual 
dictionaries. But when I presented the list to a group of linguists 
in Lyon--faculty and grad students--it turned out that about half of 
the verbs were so rare that they had to debate the meanings and 
actually look them up in dictionaries in order to decide how to act 
them out. By contrast, American preschoolers can act out very manner 
such verbs.

Of course, I'll be fascinated to learn where you going with our 
common obsession. I gave a plenary in Berlin in February, at the 
German Linguistics Society--a meeting on the 200th anniversary of 
Wilhelm von Humboldt, with the invitation to talk about language and 
concepts. I drew on your work, as you'll see in the attached 
handout, drawn from some of the slides. The motion events start on 
page 9 of the pdf. Using the Nijmegen research on static locatives 
and cut/break, I argued that we have to go beyond traditional meaning 
categories to deal with continua of various sorts, based on a number 
of interacting meaning dimensions. Then I went on to our own work in 
the Nijmegen tradition, asking people to label clips of people moving 
naturally in the world. Using correspondence analysis and 
hierarchical cluster analysis, the first split was into categorically 
separate concepts of the two basic gaits, walking and running. Then 
I turned to your work, demonstrating the same categorical perception 
on the treadmill, with categorical naming in a different set of 
languages. The upshot is that some meaning dimensions do fall into 
perceptual/motor, universal categories. But when going on to 
secondary dimensions of analysis, the languages divide up 
differently, with varying attention to dimensions of manner of motion.

I'll be in Nijmegen in the fall to write this up with Asli, and 
hopefully also Anneta Kopecka and Iraide Ibarretxe.

Do keep in touch.
Warm regards,
Dan

PS I'm copying this to several other workers on these questions to 
see if they have anything to add.
