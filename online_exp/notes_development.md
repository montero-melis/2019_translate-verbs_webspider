Notes for experiment development (together with Maarten van Heuvel)
======================================================


Questions to Maarten
--------------------

- Something off with Exp in Firefox - not working properly
- How to deal with reloading the final slide "Einde van het experiment" when it's finished? It's important for testing, but should not be there when run for real
- The fields "Nieuw veld" and "Volgende" overlap and that looks ugly -- increase the space between them


To do - Frinex
--------------

### Guillermo

- Load the right stimuli from the verbs4pilot file


### Maarten

- Counterbalancing of tasks/blocks -- how do we solve it?



To do - experiment setup
-----------------------

- Add actual DURATION estimate + PAYMENT to the consent form
- Instructions: add "This is the last task." before via-task
- Add Lilia Risman's instrument verbs


To add later on (after pilot)
-----------------------------

- Catch trials?
